Unfortunately, the template also needs to be distributed i ms word format. This
is a pain: looks ugly and less usefull. However, here is the recipe:

# compile latex source
latex qRegAnnualReport.tex

# make html from latex source
htlatex qRegAnnualReport.tex

# Next steps in libreoffice
-open qRegAnnualReport.html
-export as openoffice (odt)
-open new odt-file
-remove comments
-set page size to A4
-fix superscript on front page
-remove footnote references that points to local html-file
-adjust table
-add page breaks
-save as doc/docx
-check that all is ok



### Below is old approach that do not seem to fail for text references

#compile latex, do serveral times
latex qREgAnnualReport.tex

# then, convert markup/down
tex4ht qRegAnnualReport.tex

mk4ht oolatex qRegAnnualReport.tex

# Finallly, rename the file
mv qRegAnnualReport.odt Ã…rsrapportmal.odt

# Open the above file in libreoffice
# Update/reindex the toc
# Save as ms word 2007 format

# then, go throw yourselv out of a nearby window
